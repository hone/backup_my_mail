=== BackupMyMail
This web application provides a simple web interface for backing up both POP3 and IMAP mail.  It requires using a smtp server for sending out notices to the user when the download is ready.

=== External Dependencies
I use the spawn plugin and the rubygem rubyzip which must be installed separately.

=== Running
Normal deployment procedures for any Rails app.  `rake setup_dirs` to get public/tmp and public/download made.  Make sure they're set with 0644 permissiosn.  rake clean_up should also be cronned to be set for regularly file cleaning on a regular basis.
